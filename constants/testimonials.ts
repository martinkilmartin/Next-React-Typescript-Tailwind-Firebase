      "I chose this tour after reading numerous reviews. You will not be disappointed as everything said is true. Had a blast visiting the different sites in Ireland. Our driver Michael was giving nice commentary during the drive between places. This might have been the best coach tour I've had, just like Michael promised.",

      'What makes this experience so much more than going by yourself is MICHAEL!!! Not only can he drive those narrow roads in a huge tour bus with his eyes closed... he will give you history, education, and many jokes as you go from one location to the next. The timing at each location was appropriate and efficient to see many sites in one day. ',
